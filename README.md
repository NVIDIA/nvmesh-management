# NVMesh by NVIDIA

## Description
NVMesh by NVIDIA provides remote shared storage facilities with in-server flash performance characteristics while using commodity off-the-shelf components.

As NVMesh is a software only solution, it has the flexibility to provide storage in a hyper-converged architecture or as a top-of-rack flash appliance or as part of a dedicated storage rack.

NVMesh comprises three software elements:
* management server.
* storage client
* storage target (server)

### Management Server
The management server is used for providing storage definitions and monitoring the health and performance of the system.

### Storage Client
The storage client software implements block device functionality for storage consumers.

### Storage Target
The storage target software identifies storage hardware and sets up RDDA and non-RDDA pathways to the storage elements on behalf of the storage clients.
TOMA is part of the storage target

This repo contains the management server.
